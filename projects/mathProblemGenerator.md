 This is a project that I done in my senior year of high school for AP Computer Science Principle course. I was required to submit a program, so I created an math problem generator. This program allow users to choose what type of program and number of problems they wanted to do.  Each time user can only choose one type of problem for each problem set. After User fimish with one problem set it will show your score for that problem set and ask if user want to work on another problem set. If choose to continue then repeat the process above. If choose to stop then it will end if user answer every single problem correctly. If not, then it generate the problems that are answered incorrectly and have user keep answer till it is correctly answer. Then end the program.

 I was responsible for write the code and write an report to submit to the AP portfolio. I have a partner for this project. We just discuss what kind of program we should create. My partner do not have much experience with coding, so I was responsible for most of the coding part. Only coding is collaborative. Demo video and  report has to be done individual. 
 
 I think this is a good experience. This project walk me through the process of team collaborative coding. Construct the code then run test the program. Repeat this process till the program function correctly.
