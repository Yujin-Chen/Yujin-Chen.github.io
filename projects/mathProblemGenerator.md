This is a project that I have done in my senior year of high school for the AP Computer Science Principle course. I was required to submit a program, so I created a math problem generator. This program allows users to choose what type of program and number of problems they want to do.  Each time user can only choose one type of problem for each problem set. After the User finishes with one problem set it will show your score for that problem set and ask if the user wants to work on another problem set. If choose to continue then repeat the process above. If chooses to stop then it will end if the user answers every single problem correctly. If not, then it generates the problems that are answered incorrectly and has the user keep attempting the problem till it is answered correctly. Then the program ends.

 I was responsible for writing the code and writing a report to submit to the AP portfolio. I have a partner for this project. We just discussed what kind of program we should create. My partner do not have much experience with coding, so I was responsible for most of the coding part. Only coding is collaborative. The demo video and report have to be done individually. 
 
 I think this is a good experience. This project walks me through the process of team collaborative coding. Construct the code then run test the program. Repeat this process till the program functions correctly.
