This wesbite is created for Intro to computer science class 3rd quater final project. This is a collaborative project. I worked on this with my friend Yoon in high school. There are total of three pages: About us, Menu, and checkout page. I don't know why but for some reason during that time me and my friends are little crazyï¼Œhaving "yee-haw" as our mantra. That is why we name the website is "yee-haw" The information on About page is all made up. The about us page doesn't have any other function other thans the icons in headers. There is a header in every page. 

Next, the menu page. The menu have name, price, and image of each item on the menu. There is a drop down under every item's image. You can click on it, then it will show you the description of the item with its calories. Last page, the checkout menu. On the left side, user can type or use the button on of the input box to order how many it want for each dish or item. After user is done , then it can click on done botton then it will show the subtotal, tax, and total. Right upper section are for user to enter their contact information. The right bottom section is to help user calculate the money if use different currency. The data currency exchange rate is straight from an api. 

This website have met the requirement for full score. We did try to add more to the website but the time is up. Like in the check out page you can enter negative number when order food. The icons located on the right side of the header is not finished as well. This is the first website I have created. This experience is valuable even though the website is not perfect.
