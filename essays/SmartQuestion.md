## Smart Question
When seeking for help, it is important to ask question in a smart way would you helped efficiently. *In How to ask questions the smart way*, written by Eric Raymond have mentioned things we need to be aware of from insider perspective. He have mentioned, you would need to show you have put in effort before asking for help. If you didn't even put in effort to solve the problem and just expect someone tell you answer then why would they waste their time to solve a problem you don't even want to solve. 

You would also need to make it easy for them to identify the problem. It is helpful to state the problem's symptoms instead of what you think is causing the problem. So they would know what error they are looking for.

## Example of Not so Smart Question

There is a post on StackOverFlow with header, *Why am I getting "file not found" when trying to read another file Java*. This header did specify the problem and the programming languge. The post also state problem's symptoms:

"Here is my result: IO Error occurred:java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: mary.txt IO Error occurred:java.io.IOException: Is a directory"

It looks good so far but if you look at other part of the post you can't see the effort that the developer have put in to solve the problem. All it said, "Ive tried many many different things but just need a hand." It didn't state what specifically that she/he have done. So this would consider as not sor smart question.

## Example of Smart Question

Another post on StackOverFlow with head, *Error after chaning app's compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion*. The header have specify the problem. Then in the post developer specify it work till he changed *compileSdkVersion 34* and *targetSdkVersion 34*. Also include the symptom(error message: Execution falied for task ':app:processDebugResources' ....) instead talking about its own guesses on what cause the problem. 

Developer has put in lots of work to solve the problem. Developer have tried 7 ways to solve the problem like invalid Cahes/Restart , change the version of buildTools, and more. From this I can tell the effort that the developer have put in before ask for help. So I would consider this as an good example of smart question.

## Conclusion

Things that Eric Raymond have mentioned in *In How to ask questions the smart way* will help you get the help you need efficiently. Your post need to show you have put in effort to find the solution and really care about the problem you post. Try to think this yourelf, Would you help a person that don't even care about itself just wait till other people to help him? Header is also impotant, it let the others know specific problem you having and if its something in their field then they would most likely to help you. So post smart question is important.
