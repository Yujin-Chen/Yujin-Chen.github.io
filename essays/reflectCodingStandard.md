## My opinion on ESLint and Code Standards

After using ESLint with IntelliJ for a week, I feel annoying at first because of the red error giving and need to fix it as it go. Another thing, is that there are lots of green typo error which is annoying just because of the green squiggly line. Before using I don't even bother to care about code styling because I am only one reading my code. Teacher or professor would just need check the output but in software engineer requires team collaboration. Which others would look at your code and work from there. If your code is messy would take hours from your colleague to understand your code then start working. If your code is neat and have nice comment then it would not take long for your colleague to understand your code.

So there are something good about ESLint. Which is made the code more readable and also made other's life easier when reading your code. Coding standard would definitely help you learn because it just made your life easier to understand other people's code just because the code is clean and have comment that explains the function of that piece of code. So code standards saves time and time equals money!
