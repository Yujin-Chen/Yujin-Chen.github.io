  <h2 id="my-opinion-on-eslint-and-code-standards">My opinion on ESLint and Code Standards</h2>

<p>After using ESLint with IntelliJ for a week, I felt annoyed at first because of the red error and the need to fix it as it went. Another thing is that there are lots of green typo errors which is annoying just because of the green squiggly line. Before using I don’t even bother to care about code styling because I am the only one reading my code. The teacher or professor would just need to check the output but software engineer requires team collaboration. Which others would look at your code and start work from there. If your code is messy would take hours for your colleague to understand your code and then start working. If your code is neat and have nice comment then it would not take long for your colleague to understand your code.</p>

<p>So there is something good about ESLint. Which makes the code more readable and also makes other’s life easier when reading your code. Code standards would help you learn because it makes your life easier to understand other people’s code just because the code is clean and has comments that explain the function of that piece of code. For example, variable naming, if you name a variable “a”. Would you know what that variable represents? Probably not. It might take you hours just to figure out what is the variable for. So try to create a self-explanatory and unique variable name. Another example would be commenting. If no comment, it would take you a while you understand a function because have to trace line by line to understand what it does. Comment is also important. Many other components of code standards are helpful as well. So code standards save time and time equals money!</p>
