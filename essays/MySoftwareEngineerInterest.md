## Why am I interest in software engineer

I was introduced to computer science during my sophmore year in high school. After having some hand on experience, I find out that I like to code program. I enjoy the process of writing and find errors in the code. Writing lines of code and make it work the way I wanted to, just make feel good. Later on I took Ap computer science A and Ap computer science principle rest of my high school years. Later attend UH Manoa, I took ICS211, ICS 141, ICS 241, and ICS 311 during my freshmen year. I wanted to become an software engineer because I have used many software and hoping to create software that is needed for everyone. These course only build my coding skill but not the technique of software engineer. So for my sophmore year(2023) I enrolled in ICS 314 wishing to learn more about software engineer.
