## Why am I interest in software engineer

I was introduced to computer science during my sophmore year in high school. After having some hand on experience, I find out that I like to code program. I enjoy the process of writing and find errors in the code. Writing lines of code and make it work the way I wanted to, just make feel good. Later on I took Ap computer science A and Ap computer science principle rest of my high school years. Later attend UH Manoa, I took ICS211, ICS 141, ICS 241, and ICS 311 during my freshmen year. I wanted to become an software engineer because I have used many software and hoping to create software that is needed for everyone. These course only build my coding skill but not the technique of software engineer. So for my sophmore year(2023), I enrolled in ICS 314 wishing to learn more about software engineer.



## Skills I wish to develop in the future

I wish to develop the skill that I can quickly have some sort of structure of the code after read the instruction or listen to client's needs. I know this will the take lots time because this is depend own your experience. So it is a long process to gain this skill and I will not give. Life is learning, there is always something new available for you to learn. 

I also want to develop the skill, able to cooperate with different type software to develop software. I believe AI like Github Copilot and Chatgpt would efficiently improve my code and save time. In ICS 314 (currently taking) will help me develop the skills I need. After this course, I would also take advance software engineer course at UH Manoa and find a software engineer internship to gain work experience.
