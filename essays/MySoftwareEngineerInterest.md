## Why am I interest in software engineer

I was introduced to computer science during my sophomore year in high school. After having some hands-on experience, I found out that I like to code programs. I enjoy the process of writing and finding errors in the code. Writing lines of code and making it work the way I wanted to, just make me feel good. Later on, I took AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles rest of my high school years. Later attended UH Manoa, and I took ICS211, ICS 141, ICS 241, and ICS 311 during my freshmen year. I wanted to become a software engineer because I have used many software and hope to create software that is needed for everyone. These courses only build my coding skills but not the technique of software engineer. So for my sophomore year(2023), I enrolled in ICS 314 wishing to learn more about software engineering.



## Skills I wish to develop in the future

I wish to develop the skill that I can quickly have some sort of structure of the code after read the instruction or listen to client's needs. I know this will the take lots time because this is depend own your experience. So it is a long process to gain this skill and I will not give. Life is learning, there is always something new available for you to learn. 

I also want to develop the skill, able to cooperate with different type software to develop software. I believe AI like Github Copilot and Chatgpt would efficiently improve my code and save time. In ICS 314 (currently taking) will help me develop the skills I need. After this course, I would also take advance software engineer course at UH Manoa and find a software engineer internship to gain work experience.
