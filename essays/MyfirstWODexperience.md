I have learned that it is always great to practice before the actual test. I have done 4 practice WODs and repeated them multiple times before the actual WOD. The practice WODs are similar to the actual ones. To have better performance for the next WOD, I would do more practice WODs. I am not too confident about using objects. So I need to need to take extra time on that. The experience of WOD is valuable. It gives me an idea of where I am at right now and what I need to improve on. 

For the first WOD, I used the if-else statement to create the function. It is because the instructions are all conditional. First, check to see if the number is both a multiple of 4 and 6. If not, then check if it is a multiple of 4. Then, see if it is a multiple of 6. If the number does not satisfy any of this it will just print the number. I think it is important to discuss the WOD after it's completed. It will tell those people who failed the WOD, how to implement the code. It might also help others learn another way to implement the task and a new way of thinking. Which can help us in the future.
