  <h2 id="before-tech-talk">Before Tech Talk</h2>
<p>Before attending the professional talk. I was expecting that during the Tech Talk, Mr.Costa would talk more about the technical-related information like some kind of coding technique, useful resources that can help us, etc. During the meeting, Mr.Costa focused more on the topic of communication and interaction.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-tech-talk-thoughts">After the Tech Talk Thoughts</h2>
<p>Mr. Costa has said if you know the program you probably will be in the dark room and put your head down and start coding. Well when I heard that, I thought about myself. I will do what he just said. He also said that would be something software engineers did about 40 years ago. It is not like today, where communication and interaction are really important skills to have. Today, working as a software engineer there are lots of things you need to keep in mind. Like communicating and listening to your client. You shouldn’t do things you think are correct without notifying and communicating with your client. If they hired you then you should work based on their needs. Timely messaging, If you reply two later after you receive the message then the teammate would need to fill your gap might result in a worse possible outcome.</p>

<p>Since I enrolled as a UH Manoa computer science major till now, there have been no team collaborative assignments that were assigned in any ICS courses I have worked on. The only skill I perceive is the technical skills. No soft skills like communication and collaboration that is needed today. I have got a lot out of from Mr.Costa’s talk. It gave me an idea of what will be like working as an actual software engineer. It will help me in the future when I get into a software engineer internship.</p>
