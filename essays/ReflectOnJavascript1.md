## What I think about Javascript

I am new to Javacript language. I have never write Javascript. Before taking this class, I was think it will definitely difficult to write Javascript. After done the Javascript practice, It is actually not that hard that I was expected. Just like the java I have wrote in high school and ICS 211. It is just the syntax is slightly different. Like in Java is uses "int", "String", "Char", and Boolean to declare datatype. In Javascript, just uses "let", "const", and "var" when define the variable. Javascript will know the what datatype when you have assign the value to the variable. 

I definitely learned something from this module other than things mentioned above. From this module I have learned another type of "If-else statement" which is called Switch statement. I have never heard of this because I took AP Computer Science A (counts UH manoa ICS 111 credit), which didn't cover that. I was so confused when professors was saying something like, "you must have learned this in your ICS 111." So I am glad that the professor of ICS 314 assign a review assignment on FreeCodeCamp. Overall, Javascript is not bad.

## My opinion on WOD

After the professor introduce WOD and saying that it worth 30% of your grade. I was so worried about failing the WOD even though the professor have also mentioned it is normal fail some of the WOD. I feeling on WOD did not change until did some practice WOD and was able to finish within time. After the practice WOD it made me feel better because I was able to complete and pass the WOD. But bceause didn't take the actual WOD yet, I still feel nervous.

Despite the pressure WOD give me. WOD actually improve your coding skill. For example the "isUnique" WOD, I was thinking use nested loop to determine whether the string has repeat character. The way professor Johnson did was not an option before I watch his video. Which he creates an object and characters as property. If that character's property is true then that mean the String is not unique. Is So WODs can open your mind solve problems in different ways in the future.

So the existence of WOD is definitely

## Is it stressful?

Yes, I already feel a bit stressful beginning of the semester due to numbers of reading and assignments just in the FIRST WEEK. Just ICS 314 itself made stress because there are lots of software and other new things that are introduced. I never get in touch with those things before so I am worried that I will not do well on the assignment because lack of experience with the software. Also the numbers of assignment already posted in assignment list stress me out too. I hope I will able to come over this and rest of the semester will go smooth.
